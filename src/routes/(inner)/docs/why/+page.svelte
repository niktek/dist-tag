		<h2>What is Skeleton?</h2>
		<p>
			Skeleton is a UI library, featuring tight integration between <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Svelte</a
			>
			and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tailwind CSS</a>. In short, the library utilizes Tailwind’s
			utility class-based design system to quickly and easily customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Paired with Svelte’s
			powerful component architecture, Skeleton creates customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces for any size project.

	<!-- Problems -->
	<section class="space-y-4">
		<h2>Why Us?</h2>
		<p>
			Let’s face it - creating consistent and responsive interfaces for the web can be quite a challenge. Over time this has led to the
			emergence of UI toolkits such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bootstrap</a>,
			<a href="https://material.io/design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Material Design</a>, and
			<a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bulma</a>. These allow developers to generate a consistent UI for web
			apps within any frontend tech stack. However, these toolkits only solve half the problem - they provide beautiful UI, but in most
			cases lack the accompanying functionality needed to make interactive components for your preferred framework, leaving that burden on
			you. In some cases, they may also require extra dependencies, which can introduce choice paralysis when filtering through the plethora
			of options in modern frontend development.
		</p>
		<p>
			This has given rise to the framework-specific component libraries such as: <a
				href="https://material.angular.io/"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noreferrer">Angular Material</a
			>
			for Angular, <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vuetify</a> for Vue, and
			<a href="https://mantine.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mantine</a> for React. These tools aim to be a complete solution that goes
			beyond the surface level and allows for direct integration of framework features, while providing fully interactive components, typically
			without the need to introduce extra packages and dependencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like many in the frontend development community, we have been impressed with the introduction of <a
				href="https://svelte.dev/"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noreferrer">Svelte</a
			>
			- which provides a modern and powerful component system. Along with the
			<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SvelteKit</a> app framework, that provides a turnkey solution for
			building and iterating on web projects using Svelte and next generation tooling such as
			<a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vite</a>. However, before creating Skeleton we noticed a lack of mature
			Svelte-focused UI component libraries. While there’s plenty of
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">options</a>, many tend to focus on Material
			Design guidelines and aesthetics. While a completely valid approach, we felt there was still room for a batteries included toolkit
			that pairs the very best of what Svelte and Tailwind have to offer. This is the reason we've introduced Skeleton.
